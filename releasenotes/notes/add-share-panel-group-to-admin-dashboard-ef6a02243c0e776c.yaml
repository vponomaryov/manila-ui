features:
  - Admin dashboard now has manila-specific panel group called 'share'.
    All 'tabs' we had before are panels in this group now. Each panel
    is loaded in separate page. It allows us to avoid making redundant
    API calls that we did loading all tabs at once.
upgrade:
  - URLs for resources in admin dashboard were changed.
    One part of changes is removal of intermediate "shares" part. Example -
    was - "/admin/shares/share_networks/"
    became - "/admin/share_networks/"
    Other part is rename of resource actions to be more alike.
